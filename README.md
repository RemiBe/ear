# EAR - Explicit Algorithm Representation

## Purpose

Be able to fully describe/design a algorithm.

## How it Works

Install [tkinter](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html).
Run `python ear.py` (with Python3).

The algorithm you are building starts from the "Start" block, and
finishes on the "End" block.
In between, you can add `Function` blocks, that will likely transform
your data, and `Case` blocks, that enable to choose how to pass from
a `Function` block to another.
Link `Function` and `Case` blocks using `Arrows`.
