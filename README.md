# EAR - Explicit Algorithm Representation

## Purpose

Be able to fully describe/design a algorithm.

## How it Works

The algorithm will start from the "Start" block, and finish on the "End"
block. In between, you can add `Function` blocks, that will hopefully
transform your data, and `Case` blocks, that enable to choose how
to pass from a `Function` block to another. Link `Function` and `Case`
blocks using `Arrows`.
